This is for Github,
not for a poetry club.

People want me to rhyme
but won't pay me a dime.

The colors of the rainbow are just for show,
they do not lead to a place where we can go.

I guess we are all lost  right now
alot of info but we still in the dark
I need more than just colors to understand this hub
3 more hours and we can get out of this class
